# LifeTrack

LifeTrack is a visualization tool for raw health register data. You need to have the FINNGENID red data access to use the tool as it is, but it is fairly straightforward to adapt it into other "events over time" data sets.

LifeTrack is based on the "overview+detail" paradigm: you see the overview of the data all the time, and can access the details on demand (mouse-hover).
